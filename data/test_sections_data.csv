"Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions.

Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case, primarily in the North American economy, as well as our customers' inventory levels and available tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight in the market and related pricing. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers' business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements.

"Sales in the Aerospace OEM business are based on the general state of the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economy and are supported by its order backlog through participation in certain strategic commercial and military engine and airframe programs. Over the next several years, the Company expects strength in demand for new engines, driven by an expected increase in commercial aircraft production levels. The Company sees 2016 as having been a transition year for the Aerospace OEM business as it moves from declining production on some of its legacy engine programs onto the ramping of several new engine programs. Backlog at OEM was $626.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of 11.1% since December 31, 2015, at which time backlog was $563.9 million. Approximately 50% of OEM backlog is expected to ship in the next 12 months. The Aerospace OEM business may be impacted by changes in the content levels on certain platforms, changes in customer sourcing decisions, adjustments to customer inventory levels, commodity availability and pricing, changes in production schedules of specific engine and airframe programs, redesign of parts, quantity of parts per engine, cost schedules agreed to under contract with the engine manufacturers, as well as the pursuit and duration of new programs. Sales in the Aerospace aftermarket business may be impacted by fluctuations in end-market demand, inventory management and changes in customer sourcing, deferred or limited maintenance activity during engine shop visits and the use of surplus (used) material during the engine repair and overhaul process. End markets are expected to grow based on the long term underlying fundamentals of the aerospace industry. Management continues to believe its Aerospace aftermarket business is competitively positioned based on well-established long-term customer relationships, including maintenance and repair contracts in the MRO business and long-term Revenue Sharing Programs (""RSPs"") and Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), expanded capabilities and current capacity levels.

In addition, in such case, a U.S. shareholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common shares sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. shareholders, the Company may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common shares. In addition, such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in the Company's cash distributions, and that factor, as well as the possibility that a significant number of the Company's shareholders could determine to sell the common shares in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, may put downward pressure on the market price of the Company's common shares.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,33.1,559.3,100.1,186.7,New Times Roman,0

If these executive actions impose restrictions on FDA's ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted. Similarly, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may place at risk the FDA marketing approval for Korlym and any other marketing approval that we may obtain, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to sustain profitability.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,33.1,808.7,58.7,131.5,New Times Roman,0

The Credit Facility allows the Company to request additional revolving commitments or incremental term loans thereunder up to an aggregate additional amount of $75.0 million, subject to certain additional conditions as provided in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Principal payments under the Credit Facility are due upon maturity; however, borrowings may be repaid, at the Company's discretion, in whole or in part at any time, without penalty, subject to required notice periods and compliance with minimum prepayment amounts. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement can either be, at the Company's election: (i) at the alternate base rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus a spread; or (ii) at the Eurodollar rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus a spread. The applicable spread is dependent upon the Company's adjusted leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains conditions, representations and warranties, events of default, and indemnification provisions that are customary for financings of this type, including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, purchases and sales of assets, and certain restricted payments.

Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements.

"During the fourth quarter of 2015, upon finalizing its 2016 property level budgets, the Company identified indicators of impairment at its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York, due to declines in the current and forecasted operations of the property. The Company performed a test of recoverability and determined that the carrying value of the hotel exceeded its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The shortfall in estimated cash flows was triggered by a combination of (a) declines in existing and forecasted hotel market conditions in New York, (b) new supply in the market and (c) the loss of retail tenants at the property and the extended period of time it has taken and is estimated that it will take to re-lease the available space. The cost of transitioning to a new management company during 2015, increases in real estate taxes and the remaining term on the property's ground lease impacted the shortfall. Upon concluding that the carrying cost exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company adjusted the carrying value of the hotel (approximately $86 million) to its estimated fair market value (approximately $41 million), resulting in an impairment loss of approximately $45.0 million. The Company engaged a third party to assist with the analysis of the fair market value. The fair market value of the hotel was estimated by using the income and market approaches as outlined under ASC 820, using both observable market data (Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions and calculations (Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy). Under the income approach, the fair value estimate was calculated from a discounted cash flow analysis, using expected future cash flows based on stabilized room revenue growth rates of 1% to 4%, an estimated discount rate of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%, estimated terminal capitalization rate of 7% and other market considerations.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,33.1,561.1,235.1,348.8,New Times Roman,0

"As one of the key elements of our clinical development strategy, we seek to identify patient subsets within a disease category who may derive selective and meaningful benefit from the product candidates we are developing. In collaboration with partners, we plan to develop companion diagnostics to help us to more accurately identify patients within a particular subset, both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop companion diagnostics internally and thus we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of our third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. We and our collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for the companion diagnostics, including issues relating to selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by our collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates. In addition, our collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community. If such companion diagnostics fail to gain market acceptance, it would have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of our products.

Overall hotel operational expenses for 2016 include the results of the 56 hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger for the last four months of the year, one hotel acquired on July 1, 2016 from the date of acquisition, the results of the seven hotels acquired between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 for the full year, and the results of one hotel sold on December 6, 2016 until the date of sale. Expenses for 2015 include the results of the 19 hotels sold in 2015 until the respective dates of sale and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, hotel operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately 20 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels, favorable utility costs and the relatively fixed nature of certain operating costs such as management costs, certain utility costs and minimum supply and maintenance costs, which decline as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases, partially offset by increasing labor costs. The Company anticipates labor costs are likely to grow at increased rates due to government regulations surrounding wages, healthcare and other benefits and other government-related initiatives, such as the ""living wage"" increase, which could negatively impact operating expenses in certain markets moving forward. Additionally, labor costs have been and could be impacted in certain markets due to lower unemployment rates. With less qualified available labor, costs have increased.
